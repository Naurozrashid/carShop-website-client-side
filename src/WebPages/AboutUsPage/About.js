                  <Accordion.Body>
                    Decay is caused by bacteria that collect on teeth and feed
                    on the carbohydrates in our diet. The bacteria produce acid
                    that wears away at the enamel on our teeth. If decay is left
                    untreated, it can cause pain, infection and even tooth loss.
                    Protect your teeth against decay by brushing at least twice
                    a day, flossing daily, visiting your dentist regularly.

              <p className="py-4 text-secondary fw-light">
                It is indeed a great pleasure for me to introduce our brand new
                state of the art technology hospital in the region of
                Chittagong. Nowadays, if anyone needs good treatment, they need
                to look forward to Dhaka or Abroad. Because good and well
                facilitated hospitals are not available in the port city of
                Chittagong. <br />
                The pursuit of excellence in all these areas is the result of
                our willingness, commitment, dedication and strong moral
                determination to provide the highest quality of care.
